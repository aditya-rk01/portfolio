        <h2>16-Bit RISC Processor</h2>
        <p>
          In this project, a 16-bit non-pipelined Reduced Instruction Set Computer(RISC) processor is proposed. The processor is based on Harvard type datapath. The RISC is a microprocessor based on the design principle that favours simpler and smaller instructions that all take same amount of time to execute. RISC processors are widely used across many platforms from cellular phones to supercomputers. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The processorâ€™s instruction set consists of 13 instructions. Each instruction, memory unit (data and instruction memory) and each register is of 16 bits. The different blocks designed in the processor are Instruction memory, Data memory, General purpose registers, ALU, controlvunit of ALU, Datapath unit, Control Unit of processor. The design entry and synthesis is done using Quartus II and simulation is done using ModelSim.

        <h2>Controlled Area Network based Motor Controller</h2>
        <p>
          In this project, motor controller that communicates through Controlled Area Netwrok(CAN) is presented. Motor Controller sends and receives data from host. The host sends commands to motor driver and motor driver sends PID data to host, though CAN. The communication in which, according to the instructions from host, the motor controller runs the motor, is difficult in industries with harsh environments. Also, another challenge that engineers face is to, incorporate electronic devices that offer various features and complexities, along with the ability to communicate between devices. Controlled Area Network(CAN) solves this, where different modules can communicate with each other by a common cable.

        <h2>Digital Entry of Bank Related Slips Using Character Recognition</h2>
        <p>
          Standing in long queues in bank for small work like depositing the money is very frustrating and also wastes a lot of time. Thus, we have come up with a solution which saves time of both, the customer and the bank employees.In this paper we are going to present an idea, to use a camera, to read the entries in the deposit slips of bank, such as account no., amount, count of each denomination, etc. and enter it in the database. This concept is implemented using Handwritten text recognition using Convolutional Neural Network.

        <h2> Stock Market Visualiser</h2>
        <p>
          Stock Market Visualizer is a dashboard where the user can search different stocks and view the stock prices in the form of charts/graphs like OHLC (Open/High/Low/Close), Candlestick-chart, Colored-bar, Vertex-line and Hollow candle which are commonly used in stock trading platforms for visualization and analysis. This is done by fetching data from a JSON file and then extracting and plotting the data using various python modules such as Pandas, json, matplotlib, plotly.express, plotly.graph.objects.

        <h2>Personalized Email Generator</h2>
        <p>
          In this project, we have proposed the bulk email generator website made using Django-REST in backend and HTML,CSS in frontend and finally deployed on pythonanywhere. com. In this project we have ensured an easy methodology for generating automated emails, where the user gives a text file and excel sheet along with sender email and password as input, and personalized mails are sent to the multiple recipients.
