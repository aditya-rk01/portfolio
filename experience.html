        <h2>Week-2</h2>
        <p>
          As development to the previous week’s work, we ran our own design on Open ROAD flow, and check for results and reports. We explored the concept of static timing analysis (STA) from scratch, starting with terminologies such as setup time, hold time, slew, slack, etc.

        <h2>Week-3</h2>
        <p>
          Prepared a research paper, based on work of previous weeks titled “Design and Simulation of Universal Shift Register using open-source tools”. Learned about algorithms on partitioning, floor-planning, placement, routing steps.
